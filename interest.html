	<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
	<p>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
</p>
	<p>My interest in IT is to either do a Data Scientist or Cyber Security. My interest in IT started when I saw the people around me just talking about technology and how it is impacting our lives daily. The debate usually goes whether it’s ethical or moral the way we are moving forward. We have people scared and frightened about how advance our technology is and how we can basically find out what is going on the other side of the world with our fingertips. The question stood in front of me, what is this thing. Why are the companies choosing to opt technology and some individual having a hard time to understand the evolution of IT. These sorts of questions always came up on regular basis during social events in my family. Therefore, I decided to learn it, to truly understand What is IT.</p>
	
	<p>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p>
	
	<p>I found RMIT to be a very convenient since I am studying online, it is a very reputable University who provides great facilities to me. Graduating from RMIT would be one of my goals. It is also in the heart of the city therefore tons of food places and shopping to go after classes. Just kidding… maybe not ha-ha. </p>
	
	
	<p>What do you expect to learn during studies.</p>
	<p>I expect to learn a little bit of Networking to help me understand the branch of Cyber Security, it  would be really beneficial for me in the future, since that is one of my dream jobs, I would also love to learn about Big Data where I would finally make a decision whether I would want to pursue further with Data Science or Cyber Security.</p>

	<h1>Project</h1>
	<p>The project I’m looking to design is an app that would be useful for our customers who struggle to pay their bills on time due to having many different transactions coming out of their bank account on different days. Sometimes we forget to pay the bill just because all we need is a reminder. With our Bill Reminder app specifically designed to help you in difficult situations like so you don't face the late payment fee or get that pay on time discount for your energy bills really helps our  customers out by saving those extra dollars in our  savings account. The aim is to send a friendly reminder on their phone, we will then send our notification which will inform our customers that a particular bill is due on the day their bill is due with the amount as well to make sure all the areas are covered. </p>
	
	<h4>Motivation</h4>
	<p>Now we all know gone are the days of using cash and making a full payment on products and services, Australians have also adapted well to the technological  world where everyone can make a partial payment using tons of different services such as PayPal, Afterpay, Zippay, Pay It Later, Humm and the most important ones such as your rent, rates and energy bill, water bill. Regardless of whatever company you must pay it’s so hard to track these things and sometimes we may forget it.  According to a recent report by My CRA (Credit Reporting Agency), thousands of Australians are forgetting to pay small bills such as their phone or credit card bills which ruins their credit rating for up to four years. </p>
	
	
	<h4>Description</h4>
	<p>The App will feature a scanner using your phone. The app will use the phone camera to scan the bill, by scanning the app will confirm the details with our customer the following information is accurate, however if the bill is sent to you through email, you can use our upload option for our software’s to detect the due date, the amount, and the organisation the money is due for.</p>
	
	<p>Furthermore, for unfortunate circumstances we have also got a manual way to add the bills by selecting the (Add bill) option and by choosing this the customers can physically add their bill while our maintenance team will be working their best to upgrade or fix the scanner or the upload method when they are due for upgradations/maintenance.</p>
	
	<p>Our App will be able to send reminders as notification for the customers. We will send a notification about a particular bill 2 days before the due date as a friendly reminder that they need an x amount on them. If the customer decides to pay the bill before the due date, we will then have the option for them to that they don’t need to be reminded anymore for that bill.</p>
	
	<p>However, if the customer hasn’t paid the bill before the due date, they will then get a reminder of their bill is due today. If the customers decide to pay for it that day then they can just choose the option that their bill is paid, therefore no reminders would be sent to our customers for that bill.</p>
	
	<p>Furthermore, we all at certain times struggle to pay our bill on time, whether it may be one or too many, you know where you stand at and for very different reasons too. We will be sending out a final reminder for our customer when the bill has been overdue for 55 days, to just let our customers know that if they are unable to pay this bill, the organisation has the right to report a particular individual to the CRA (Credit Reporting Agency) about the rating which would potentially affect their credit.</p>
	
	<p>Since we also deal with such sensitive information such as their Names, Addresses, E-mails, Account Numbers and Passwords. We also need to ensure the data we have is well protected. We protect our customers by having a two-factor authentication code linked with Microsoft. The customers must have this when they are setting up our App on their phone, without the authentication customers is unable access their app. The customers can later improve their security by adding their biometrics on their phone which helps with accessibility of our App.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
	<p>The software skills we will need to build Our App is using Java for our Android users and Swift for our iOS users so we can cover majority of our customers. We would also need XML for designing purposes and SQL for our database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operation. We will also need to start building a cloud security strategy to reduce risk from modern day threats and to ensure all the data is secured to protect our customers. We would also then deploy a DNS-layer protection to mitigate data risk.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Outcome</h4>
	<p>If the project is successful, the outcome will be hundreds of Australians credit rating will go back to normal. A negative credit rating can affect their ability to take out a loan and apply for crucial things such as a car, home, and personal loans. A positive financial action can help bring a low credit score back up to average. A good credit rating allows people, companies, and government to easily borrow from financial institutions. Therefore, the impact would be huge considering credit rating are also important at the country level. The  development for Australia would be great since a company looking to open a factory may first look at the country’s credit rating to assess its stability before deciding to invest. Therefore, all these factors would make our life much easier by managing things at a small level such as an individual. </p>
